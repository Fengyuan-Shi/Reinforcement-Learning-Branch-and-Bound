1. multi dimension issue within sampling data representation
2. Need unified naming among BB files
3. Need benchmarks
4. Passing messages among nodes in a graph: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.01212.pdf
5. Reward calculation. Currently by 1-|value in function| and collect all terminal reward as training example
6. backtrack

1. We need a systemetic guide/ introduction to branch and bound.
2. We need a systemetic guide/ introduction to branch and bound.
3. How to choose the middle value to cut? Why 0.4 ?
4. Does relaxation mean making problem easier?
5. what does subproblem infeasible mean? 
6. Documentation for pyibex.
7. Representation of the value, can it be all nagative?
8. Representation of the state.
9. When it reaches ternimal, how to calculate its reward? Possible approach: calculate the mean give the lower and upper value.
